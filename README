use the codes in code/python to generate a list of Q points on the surface of a sphere.

use run_sqw_v2 and auto_sqw_v2 to call snaxs and generate the sqw for each q point. 

these will produce out_*.mat and out_*_delta_fn.mat. the first one has the colormap sqe 
array in it. this includes resoultion broadening, kinematic cutoff, and all options set
in auto_sqw_v2. the delta_fn one has the intensities as delta_fns in energy. these can 
be used to produce your own colormaps, etc.

note that the delta_fn one is typical .mat file that can be read by scipy.io.loadmat 
where as the other one is for storing large variables and is the matlab v7.3 type. this
can be read by h5py.

the plot scripts in code/plot can be used to plot the outputs of snaxs.
